# Predicting Loan Default and Employment

Predict whether someone will default on their loan as well as if they are employed.

The original csv dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/kmldas/loan-default-prediction

This prediction model uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method to classify a new test-row as employed/unemployed and default/pay-off. The entire dataset from the link above contains 10,000 rows of data... 9,000 are used for training and 1,000 are used for testing. 

The greatest accuracy, upwards of 70%, is achieved when using k=7. 

The notebook in this project walks the reader through the process of understanding the data, cleaning the data, describing the data, and finally predicting with the data.
